# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat test test/Counter.js

REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js


// task
npx hardhat balance --account 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266

```
